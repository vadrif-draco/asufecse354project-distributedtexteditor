# Distributed Text Editor

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 14.0.2.

## Commands

- If you've just forked/cloned this repository, you must run `npm install` to install all of the required dependencies for it to run.

- Run `ng serve` for a client-side dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
    - Side note: If you are prompted to address some vulnerabilities, please respect the warning (that addressing these issues may introduce app-breaking changes) and DO NOT RUN `npm audit fix --force`.

- Run `npm run start:server` for the coressponding server-side dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:3000/` to preview it if you wish, though the requests are done through the API routes -- i.e., nothing to preview in the root path. The server will automatically reload if you've installed nodemon successfully (it is in dev dependencies).

- Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.
